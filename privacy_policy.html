    <h2>2. Data Usage</h2>

    <p>Night Tales does not track user activities or collect any analytics. It functions offline, and no personal information is required for app usage. The app solely provides text-based content for reading public domain fairy tales and mythologies.</p>

    <h2>3. In-App Purchases</h2>

    <p>Night Tales offers in-app purchases for unlocking premium stories and accessing additional features like bookmarks. These transactions are handled through the Apple App Store's secure payment system. Apple may collect personal and financial data during this process, which is governed by Apple’s Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>4. No User Data Storage</h2>

    <p>We do not collect or store any personal information or usage data from our users. Your reading activity, preferences, or any other personal information is not stored in our system.</p>

    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>

    <p>Night Tales is intended for a general audience. However, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children under the age of 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it immediately. Parents can contact us if they believe their child has shared personal information through the app.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>

    <p>Since Night Tales does not collect or store personal data, there are no security risks regarding personal data storage. However, the app may utilize Apple's standard security measures for transactions and in-app purchases through the App Store.</p>
